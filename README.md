# bootstrap-email-solis-02 DEV-LOG 
9/22/2023 - Day One 

6PM-730PM
Started on the mockup of the bootstrap project in Figma. I have a general idea of how I'm going to set up the design across all three screens. The design of the phone screen is similar to that of Gmail, the tablet is modified layout of the desktop Gmail format and the desktop screen will be similar to Outlook. My color scheme for this project is probably dark gray, black, and white, however if the project looks too dull I may have to reconsider the colors.
